# layers

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of layers is to provide a simple library for doing common reinsurance calculations outside of Analyze Re.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `layers` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jfkingiii/layers")
```
## Example

Use the included sample yelt, `yelt_test` to try out some of the `layers` functions.

```{r example}
library(layers)

# Look at the help files
help(package=layers)

# Create some layers and get their metrics
options(scipen = 999)
test_layer <- layer(4000000, 1000000, 1, "yelt_test", lobs=c("PHYSICIANS","CHC","MEDCHOICE"))
gross_layer <- layer(UNLIMITED, 0, 1, "yelt_test", lobs=c("PHYSICIANS","CHC","MEDCHOICE","HOSPITAL"))
# Aggregate limits and deductibles are optional and default to UNLIMITED and 0.
test_layer

gross_layer

summary(test_layer)

summary(gross_layer)

# Test some OEPs
VaR(gross_layer, 1 - 1/25, "OEP")
VaR(gross_layer, 1 - 1/100, "OEP")
VaR(test_layer, 1 - 1/100, "OEP")
VaR(test_layer, 1 - 1/100, "OEP")

# Try a layer with aggregate parameters
agg_layer <- layer(4000000, 1000000, 1, "yelt_test", lobs=c("PHYSICIANS","CHC","MEDCHOICE"),
                   agg_attachment = 4000000, agg_limit = 12000000)
summary(agg_layer)
```
